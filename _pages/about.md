Hello！

I’m Qin Haojun, a student in Computational Mathematics at the School of Mathematical Sciences, University of Science and Technology of China.

Currectly I am interested in Numerical methods for PDEs and some algorithms for Physics and Engineering problems. And I have also worked on machine learning algorithms for PDEs called the Random Feature Method under the guidance of Professor Chen Jingrun and Professor Wang Xiaoping.

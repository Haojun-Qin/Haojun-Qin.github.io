The use of deep learning methods for solving partial differential equations (PDEs) has become a vibrant research area in recent years. A long list of machine learning methods for PDEs have been proposed, such as Deep Ritz method, Deep Garlerkin method, physics-informed neural networks (PINNs). Team of Professor Jingrun Chen in University of Science and Technology of China, proposed a new method named the Random Feature Method (RFM) bridging traditional and machine learning-based algorithms for solving PDEs. In this talk, I will introduce how I apply the augmented Lagrangian method, penalty method and enforce the exact boundary conditions to RFM. And I will present the numerical result of Helmhotz equation, Poisson equation, 2-D elasticity equation and discuss the numerical characteristics of RFM.
